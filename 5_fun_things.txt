Five* "Fun" Things to do with Ruby String Manipulation

Learning to code requires trial and error.
Sticking with it requires goals you want to achieve.
Having fun with code encourages you to play, explore and learn.
In this session I'll share the knowledge of some simple coding concepts, and a couple of ways to display these as 'fun' outcomes you can see on a terminal using Ruby code.


* Might not be five.
* Might not be fun.


- na * 16
- Generate an ascii snake (random walk)
  - iteration
  - arithmetic on strings (vs injection)
  - random walk
- Climbing bars (classes, attributes)
- Falling sand (cellular automata)
- Vowel swapping



s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
vowels = %w{a e i o u}
puts s

vowels.each_with_index do |vowel, index|
  s.gsub!(vowel,"SUB#{index}SUB")
end
puts s
vowels.each_with_index do |vowel, index|
  s.gsub!("SUB#{index}SUB", vowels[(index+1)%vowels.length])
end
puts s
